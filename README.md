                                                                  (SUMMARY)
                                                                  
                            Rapidly evolving technology and internet network since the turn of the 21st century, the
                            usage areas and processing capacities of smartphones have increased significantly. This is
                            enabled smartphones to be used in different areas, allowing many new smartphone
                            applications (mobile applications) to emerge. Especially after 2010, there was a significant
                            increase in smartphone applications and many applications were made available to them.
                            
                            Following these developments, the banking and finance sector took its place in this area
                            with many mobile applications. In today, almost every bank has mobile banking besides
                            internet banking. As a result of this virtualization of banking, QNB Finansbank established
                            
                            Enpara, which is Turkey's first digital bank in October 2012 and offers all its services

                            The aim of this project is to present the Exchange and Gold Prices section of the
                            Enlargement Mobile Applications Pricing and Ratios section in a new application to
                            customers and users, to inform users about instant currency and gold price changes and to
